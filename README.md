cashRegisterProject


Cash Register project made in vanilla javascript/html5/css 

By far the project I enjoyed working on the most. I used to be a delivery driver for Jimmy Johns and was inspired to make a register that worked similarly allowing the user convienient access to the cart, items, and calculator. 

no apis/libraries were used.

Notes:
1.) The register is only functional from an input standpoint. You cannot actually withdraw individual coins yourself, it will do it automatically whichever way is the most efficient. There are a couple sort algorithms used here.
2.) I code with dark-reader on and often-times I forget to turn it off when I'm editing the stylesheet. Results may vary
3.) plenty of room to make this more functional. The style I went for besides being based off fast food terminals, was a retro video game feel.

ok that's it.
